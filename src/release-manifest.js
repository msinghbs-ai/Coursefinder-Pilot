  changes:[
    'Batch rules preview opens in one panel under the rules list, with fixed-width columns; long course names and page wording are shortened, with the full text on hover.',
    'If an action on Batch rules fails, the reason is shown right there instead of only at the top of the page.'

  bugFixes:[
    'Approve & run on a batch rule did nothing: the run log was refused by the database, so the approval was undone. Fixed; approving now admits the fees at once.'

// Ordered accepted releases. The first item is the only recovery baseline for a new candidate.
// Historical releases before this central manifest remain retained by the legacy release-history source.

    title:'Dispatcher tuning & run metrics',
    changes:[
      'Administration > Scraper Config now separates vendor controls from governed Layer 2 dispatcher tuning.',
      'Admins can compare recent runs using throughput, response/extraction latency, retries, Evidence, field resolution and Layer 2/Layer 3/blocked outcomes.',
      'PIM/Data Admins can tune batch size, run concurrency, stale recovery and paid-attempt limits for subsequent runs with an auditable governance reason.',
      'Running batches retain their immutable policy snapshot; tuning never rewrites work already in flight.',
      'Hourly CourseFinder metrics track dispatcher continuations, provider performance, Evidence and policy snapshots for evidence-based tuning.'
    ],
    bugFixes:[
      'Retains the Layer 2 runner transport safety cap introduced by PR #84: ordinary invocations remain capped at four items and scraper-first invocations at two.',
      'Dispatcher metrics are sanitized and do not expose raw payloads, result/error text, target URLs, Storage paths or provider credentials.',
      'Preserves Layer 1 authority, Layer 3 Evidence/profile/model governance, Layer 4 human authority and separate Search/Publication admission.'
