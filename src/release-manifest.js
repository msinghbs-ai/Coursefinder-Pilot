    changes:[
      'Administration > Scraper Config now separates vendor controls from governed Layer 2 dispatcher tuning.',
      'Admins can compare recent runs using throughput, response/extraction latency, retries, Evidence, field resolution and Layer 2/Layer 3/blocked outcomes.',
      'PIM/Data Admins can tune batch size, run concurrency, stale recovery and paid-attempt limits for subsequent runs with an auditable governance reason.',

      'Hourly CourseFinder metrics track dispatcher continuations, provider performance, Evidence and policy snapshots for evidence-based tuning.'

      'Retains the Layer 2 runner transport safety cap introduced by PR #84: ordinary invocations remain capped at four items and scraper-first invocations at two.',
      'Dispatcher metrics are sanitized and do not expose raw payloads, result/error text, target URLs, Storage paths or provider credentials.',
      'Preserves Layer 1 authority, Layer 3 Evidence/profile/model governance, Layer 4 human authority and separate Search/Publication admission.'
