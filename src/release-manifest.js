  title:'Course Intake Run & Validate',
  changes:[
    'Layer 2/3 Operations has a Course Intake Run & Validate screen: choose the approved top Australian universities, preview eligible courses and their official evidence (with every university shown, including those with none and why), fix an audited cohort, run the intake job once through the governed Run Now, and inspect the result, the before and after values and the website and Zoho read-back.',
    'Each university in the scope is now evaluated separately, so one large university can no longer take the whole preview.',
    'Run Now records its result with the platform\'s outcome codes, so a run is kept instead of being rolled back.'

// Ordered accepted releases. The first item is the only recovery baseline for a new candidate.
// Historical releases before this central manifest remain retained by the legacy release-history source.

    title:'Dispatcher tuning & run metrics',
    changes:[
      'Administration > Scraper Config now separates vendor controls from governed Layer 2 dispatcher tuning.',
      'Admins can compare recent runs using throughput, response/extraction latency, retries, Evidence, field resolution and Layer 2/Layer 3/blocked outcomes.',
      'PIM/Data Admins can tune batch size, run concurrency, stale recovery and paid-attempt limits for subsequent runs with an auditable governance reason.',
      'Running batches retain their immutable policy snapshot; tuning never rewrites work already in flight.',
      'Hourly CourseFinder metrics track dispatcher continuations, provider performance, Evidence and policy snapshots for evidence-based tuning.'
    ],
    bugFixes:[
      'Retains the Layer 2 runner transport safety cap introduced by PR #84: ordinary invocations remain capped at four items and scraper-first invocations at two.',
      'Dispatcher metrics are sanitized and do not expose raw payloads, result/error text, target URLs, Storage paths or provider credentials.',
      'Preserves Layer 1 authority, Layer 3 Evidence/profile/model governance, Layer 4 human authority and separate Search/Publication admission.'
