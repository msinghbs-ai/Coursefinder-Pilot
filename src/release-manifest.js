  changes:[
    'Every hour the waste check measures repeated searches, repeated AI reads of the same evidence, paid reads of pages already stored, retry loops and scans of ineligible providers, and opens one issue per kind of waste.',
    'Breakers that refuse or hold wasteful work are built into the existing Firecrawl and AI guards and ship switched off; no budget, share or ceiling changes.',
    'A value estimate for each planned step and a cost-per-verified-improvement report by lane are available to the planner and the operations report.'

    title:'Dispatcher tuning & run metrics',
    changes:[
      'Administration > Scraper Config now separates vendor controls from governed Layer 2 dispatcher tuning.',
      'Admins can compare recent runs using throughput, response/extraction latency, retries, Evidence, field resolution and Layer 2/Layer 3/blocked outcomes.',
      'PIM/Data Admins can tune batch size, run concurrency, stale recovery and paid-attempt limits for subsequent runs with an auditable governance reason.',
      'Running batches retain their immutable policy snapshot; tuning never rewrites work already in flight.',
      'Hourly CourseFinder metrics track dispatcher continuations, provider performance, Evidence and policy snapshots for evidence-based tuning.'
    ],
    bugFixes:[
      'Retains the Layer 2 runner transport safety cap introduced by PR #84: ordinary invocations remain capped at four items and scraper-first invocations at two.',
      'Dispatcher metrics are sanitized and do not expose raw payloads, result/error text, target URLs, Storage paths or provider credentials.',
      'Preserves Layer 1 authority, Layer 3 Evidence/profile/model governance, Layer 4 human authority and separate Search/Publication admission.'
