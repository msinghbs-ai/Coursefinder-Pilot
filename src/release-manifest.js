  title:'Hotfix 2: a person\'s course page search spends its credits',
  changes:[
    'Task manager: a Find course pages task that is sent to the search but whose credits are refused now says so (Blocked: credits refused, and why) instead of looking alive.',
    'Consumer API unchanged (Decision 266).'
  ],
  bugFixes:[
    'Find course pages started by a person at a university whose automatic search had stopped was handed to the search but every credit was refused, so nothing was searched; the credit check now lets a person\'s task through as the search queue does. Budgets and the target-only rule still apply.'

    title:'Dispatcher tuning & run metrics',
    changes:[
      'Administration > Scraper Config now separates vendor controls from governed Layer 2 dispatcher tuning.',
      'Admins can compare recent runs using throughput, response/extraction latency, retries, Evidence, field resolution and Layer 2/Layer 3/blocked outcomes.',
      'PIM/Data Admins can tune batch size, run concurrency, stale recovery and paid-attempt limits for subsequent runs with an auditable governance reason.',
      'Running batches retain their immutable policy snapshot; tuning never rewrites work already in flight.',
      'Hourly CourseFinder metrics track dispatcher continuations, provider performance, Evidence and policy snapshots for evidence-based tuning.'
    ],
    bugFixes:[
      'Retains the Layer 2 runner transport safety cap introduced by PR #84: ordinary invocations remain capped at four items and scraper-first invocations at two.',
      'Dispatcher metrics are sanitized and do not expose raw payloads, result/error text, target URLs, Storage paths or provider credentials.',
      'Preserves Layer 1 authority, Layer 3 Evidence/profile/model governance, Layer 4 human authority and separate Search/Publication admission.'
